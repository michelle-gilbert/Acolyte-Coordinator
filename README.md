Worked on a two person volunteer team with a church staff member in coordinating the scheduling of confirmands in the service roles of Acolyte and Coffe Bar Attendants.  A service coordination software package called Planning Center Online (PCO) was used in the following ways:
- communicate with the students, the student's families
- sign up to serve for specific dates and times
- run standard reports to generate lists of students
- standard maintenance of the database to add, change, and delete information as confirmands moved into and out of the program
- create new ad hoc reports to identify gaps and situations for intervention.
 
I learned the internal tools and language of PCO to create reports to help the Confirmation Leaders identify which students and/or families either need assistance using the software or encouragement to get on the schedule to fulfill the program requirements.

Included in this repository
- original report from PCO which lead to more questions than answers  
-     (report format MGilbert - Acolyte and Coffee Bar future schedule with login info)
- sample ad hoc report that I created to provide more details on the confirmand's use of PCO
